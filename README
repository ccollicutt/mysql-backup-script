This is a quick backup script that will dump all the mysql databases to a file in a directory on the localhost and then rsync that directory over ssh to a remote host.

The backups script goes into /etc/cron.daily.

Required files and directories

- /etc/mysql-backup
- backup and backup.pub which are the ssh keypair used for the remote login, and the public key would have to be in the remote users authorize_keys file
- my.cnf which has the information required to login to mysql and also what host

Note that this is just a quick script that needs a lot of work.

Also, with regards to ssh keys, I usually add this to the beginning of the keys line in authorized_keys:

no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-pty,from="<some_ip_address>" ...
