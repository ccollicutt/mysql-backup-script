Note that this is just a quick script that needs a lot of work. :)

This is a backup script that will dump all the mysql databases to a .gz file in a specified directory on the localhost and then rsync that directory over ssh to a remote host.

The backups script goes into /etc/cron.daily and will thus be run once a day.

Required files and directories
==============================

- /etc/mysql-backup
- backup and backup.pub which are the ssh keypair used for the remote login, and the public key would have to be in the remote users authorize_keys file
- my.cnf which has the information required to login to mysql and also what host
- A local directory to backup mysql to, usually /var/lib/backups/mysql

SSH Keys
========

With regards to ssh keys, I usually add this to the beginning of the keys line in authorized_keys:

no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-pty,from="<some_ip_address>" ...
