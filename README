This is a quick backup script that will dump all the mysql databases to a file in a directory on the localhost and then rsync that directory over ssh to a remote host.

Required files:
- backup and backup.pub which are the ssh keypair used for the remote login
- my.cnf which has the information required to login to mysql and also what host
